After you install a Console agent in Google Cloud, the NetApp Console can automatically discover information about the Google Cloud Storage buckets that reside in the Google account where the Console agent is installed. A Google Cloud Storage system is added to the Console so you can view this information.

You can see details about your Google Cloud Storage buckets, including the location, access status, storage class, total and used capacity, and more. These buckets can be used as destinations for NetApp Backup and Recovery, NetApp Cloud Tiering, or NetApp Copy and Sync operations.
